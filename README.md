Syntax coloring used:

- **Arc**: Base16 Tommorow Dark
- **Adapta**: [Mattia Astorino's great Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme) (an alternative to this Adapta theme!)
- **United Ubuntu** & **Ambiance**: Base16 IR Black

I created these themes myself to suit my needs - I hope you will like them too!
